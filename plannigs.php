          If you are working out towards your goal you should eat accordingly. Recall section of hypertrophy training –
          if you want to gain muscle mass you need to follow a diet that will complement your training schedule. This
          section is all about it. I have always been reluctant to strict diet plans as they are really hard to stick to
          and few people actually do it. I myself found it hard. That is why I focus on principles of how to eat that
          you can incorporate to your everyday diet. Do not rush, it is much better to incorporate these eating habits
          step by step but being consistent with it rather than being super strict about your diet just for a week or
          two.
